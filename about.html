<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Parth Dave, a passionate and driven Software Engineering student currently pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Queensland, Australia. With a strong academic background in Computer Science and Engineering, I thrive on solving complex problems and creating innovative software solutions.</p>
<p>My journey in technology began with a deep curiosity for programming, which led me to develop a Python-based data acquisition system for aerosol monitoring during my internship at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL). This project not only honed my technical skills in Python, data visualization, and hardware interfacing but also reinforced my ability to collaborate in a research-driven environment.</p>
<p>Beyond technical expertise, I am a lifelong learner, constantly expanding my knowledge through certifications in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Generative AI. My hands-on experience in web development, cloud computing, and data analytics reflects my versatility and commitment to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new cuisines, traveling, or playing competitive sports like tennis—a discipline that has taught me resilience, teamwork, and strategic thinking.</p>
<p>I am eager to leverage my skills and enthusiasm in an internship or industry placement, contributing to impactful projects while growing as a global software professional. Let’s connect and build the future of tech together!</p>
